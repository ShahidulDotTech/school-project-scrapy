18 July 2022,3-D food printing,Dr Samantha Sawyer,"This project is to research factors that govern the quality of products that can be produced by 3D food printing for valorisation of food grade seconds and wastes. Regionally, lower grade food products such as mechanically recovered meats and second grade fruit and vegetables could be stabilised into feed streams for future food printing or other restructuring technologies. However, high-throughput commercial applications of 3D food printing will require feed streams that are stabilised and optimised for producing quality printed foods. Formulation, combined with food preservation systems, such as microwave assisted thermal sterilisation (MATS) or flow-through UHT will be required to make shelf-stable bulk food ingredients for 3D-food printing production lines.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/3-d-food-printing,Samantha.Sawyer@utas.edu.au

18 July 2022,Mammal responses to forestry &amp; wildfire,A/Prof Sue Baker,"How to meet human needs for timber while limiting harm to biodiversity is an urgent scientific goal. This Australian Research Council funded PhD project will address this challenge by quantifying the impacts of forestry systems and wildfire on mammal species. This project will involve field-based camera trap surveys to quantify impacts of disturbance on the abundance of individual mammal species, looking at both alien-invasive and native species. Sample sites range across a disturbance gradient from unmanaged old-growth and recently fire-impacted sites, through to native forest logging and exotic species timber plantations. This will enable the most comprehensive analysis to date of logging system and wildfire impacts on mammalian biodiversity. Sophisticated modelling will integrate data on mammal frequencies with expected timber yield under the land sparing vs land sharing framework. This paradigm explicitly factors in trade-offs between the site-level intensity of forestry practices and the possible amount of reserves. Analysis will determine the landscape composition of reserves and forestry systems that best support native mammal communities for a given yield of timber.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/mammal-responses-to-forestry-and-wildfire,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/Sue-Baker

18 July 2022,How do plants open up?,Dr Frances Sussmilch,"The evolution of the adjustable stomatal pore was a major event in the development of life on land. Stomatal opening enables plants to acquire carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and growth, while closure prevents excessive plant water loss. In flowering plants, stomata open to acquire CO2 in response to signals including blue and red light, low intracellular CO2, and the plant's internal timekeeper – the circadian clock. Circadian rhythms enable plants to predict and prepare for regular environmental changes including dawn and dusk.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/how-do-plants-open-up,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/Frances-Sussmilch

18 July 2022,Evolution of plant cellular responses to water,Dr Frances Sussmilch,"The successful conquest of dry land by plants depended on the evolution of mechanisms to manage the acquisition and loss of water. These mechanisms are fundamentally important to plant success in nature and in agriculture. Plants must maintain the turgor of their cells in order to grow and retain the rigidity and structural integrity of tissues and organs, including leaves. Loss of cell turgor during water loss causes wilting, and at some critical point tissue death. Plants can increase cell turgor by increasing the concentration of salts and organic molecules to drive the uptake of water via osmosis. The capacity for a plant to maintain cell turgor pressure is vital for growth and is strongly correlated with drought tolerance.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/Evolution-of-plant-cellular-responses-to-water,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/Frances-Sussmilch

18 July 2022,Understanding the role of police in regional Australia,Prof Nicole Asquith,"Too often we assume to know what police do; yet, to date, there has been no Australian research undertaken to map exactly what police do in their everyday duties. While Tasmania Police officers are compelled by the Tasmanian Government to undertake the core tasks of criminal investigation, public order maintenance, emergency management, and traffic policing, anecdotal evidence suggests that they do much more, and many of these non-core duties may be more appropriately assigned to other frontline services. These secondary tasks are often undertaken by police with limited training and resourcing, and with limited consideration of the vicarious trauma and mental fatigue associated with this work. In this collaborative project between the Tasmanian Institute of Law Enforcement Studies, The Police Association of Tasmania, and Tasmania Police, candidates will work closely with frontline police to map their duties, investigate the wellbeing of officers, and to consider what, if any, solutions can be offered to redirect tasks that are better addressed by community organisations, businesses, and other public servants.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/social-sciences/understanding-the-role-of-police-in-regional-australia,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tiles/nicole-asquith

Starting with the innovations of community policing in the 1960s, policing organisations in western democracies have sought to change the relationships between policing organisations and the communities they serve as a means to reduce crime. Yet, other more recent innovations in policing, such as problem-oriented and intelligence-led approaches, have in some cases damaged the trust in police and deepened existing inequalities.","https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/social-sciences/evidence-based,-intelligence-led,-and-knowledge-based-policing-identifying-better-practices-for-creating-public-safety-and-preparing-police-for-complexity",https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tiles/nicole-asquith

18 July 2022,Building resilient tourism regions through technology,A/Prof Anne Hardy,"COVID-19 has had profound impacts upon the tourism industry. While some regions are suffering, others are flourishing as tourists disperse in different ways and react to COVID-19 lockdowns, border closures and outbreaks. As a result, debate has emerged over what a sustainable tourism future should look like, as well as where and how tourists should travel through Tasmania. Technology offers a means to mitigate these debates.  When used ethically it can assist in understanding where and how tourist travel, it can enhance experiences in destinations, and it can encourage behaviour change. Ultimately it has the ability to build more resilient tourism regions. This project seeks to build upon the highly successful Tourism Tracer project and use technology as a means through which the visitor experience can be augmented, regional dispersal can be monitored, and behaviour change can be encouraged to enhance more sustainable outcomes in regional Tasmania. We are seeking students with a passion for tourism who can assess, design, evaluate or augment the Tourism Tracer technology, which is a sensor based technology that includes use location based tracking, surveys and real time data visualisations.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/social-sciences/building-resilient-tourism-regions-through-technology,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/sociology/anne-hardy

18 July 2022,Temperature and growth habit in pulses,A/Prof Jim Weller,"The global demand for protein derived from plants is increasing rapidly and so is the importance in understanding and harnessing the genetic variation for adaptation to climate change and future farming systems. Phenology and plant architecture play an important role in adaptation to contrasting photo-thermal and drought environments. Daylength and temperature are primary drivers of time to flowering, and temperature also influences pod set and grain filling, critical stages for yield loss. While independent regulation of plant architecture has been observed in some pulses, pleiotropic effects of daylength sensitivity have been reported, as well as a link between light quality perception, which influences branching and height, and temperature sensing in other species.A field-based comparison of genotypes across a gradient of photo-thermal environments and water availability found that pod and seed number per unit area were the variables better associated with yield, as was the growth rate during podding-grain filling and seed number, both with genotype-dependent responses. The mechanisms and extent of genotypic diversity in the response of pulses to ambient temperature and light quality driving the balance between phenology (timing, rate and duration) and architecture is not known.

The genetic markers will also be used to investigate dispersal and residency across fine and broad spatial scales, complementing simultaneous research involving GPS-tracked eagles. Finally, assay techniques will be developed for a subset of markers such that they can be applied to degraded DNA samples representing eagle mortalities or shed feathers, addressing questions regarding the genetic provenance and parentage of individuals.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/conservation-genetics-of-wt-eagles,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/chris-burridge
18 July 2022,Behavioural evolution in Tasmanian devil,A/Prof Menna Jones,"Novel infectious diseases can cause high mortality in the host animal leading to severe population decline. Tasmanian devils have suffered more than 80% population decline across their range in the last 25 years due to a rare, fatal transmissible cancer – devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD is spread by biting and kills most devils once they reach sexual maturity as they bite each other during the mating season. Extreme adult mortality will create strong evolutionary selection pressure and we expect that both devils and their tumours will evolve towards an endemic state in which they coexist with potential recovery of the devil population. Population decline has now stabilised, and devils persist in long-diseased areas of Tasmania. Devils are evolving resistance to the disease, and their dispersal patterns, life history and behaviour are changing. There appears to be a reduction in aggression, which may reduce the chance of becoming infected.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/behavioural-evolution-in-tasmanian-devil,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/menna-jones
18 July 2022,Beetle conservation in forest landscapes,A/Prof Sue Baker,"This PhD projects will survey the diverse ground-active beetle communities in Tasmania’s beautiful forests. The project will involve fieldwork in unmanaged reserves and old-growth forest, previously harvested forests and recent fire-impacted sites in a landscape ecology study. Beetles are known to be sensitive to habitat modification by timber harvesting and wildfire. Beetle species vary widely in dispersal ability, feeding guilds and habitat requirements. Thus different approaches to native and plantation forest management could have varying impacts on beetle communities. This project will contribute to a large ARC study investigating the complex trade-offs involved between biodiversity conservation and timber production. It will investigate the characteristics of species that are resilient to particular management practices vs. those that are detrimentally impacted. The responses of numerous beetle species will be linked with timber yield/revenue data across contrasting management systems in a large landscape ecology study.

The Hubble constant is a parameter that describes the rate of change of the expansion of our universe. Measurements of the Hubble constant based on local observations [Riess, et al. Astrophysical Journal, 826, 56 (2016)] are in tension with the measurements based on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation [Planck Collaboration, Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, 594, A13, (2016)]. The CMB was emitted when the Universe was very young, whereas the local observations are sensitive to the late epochs of the universe. Possible solutions of this tension range for the scenarios relevant to the early universe [Poulin, et al. Physical Review Letters, 122, 221301 (2019)], or local universe [Desmond, et al.

18 July 2022,Precision astrometry for spacecraft tracking,Prof Simon Ellingsen,"Traditionally the tracking of interplanetary spacecraft is undertaken with large aperture antennas such as those operated by the NASA Deep Space Network. Tracking with this type of instrument has limited angular resolution and this corresponds to increasingly worse linear resolution as the distance of the spacecraft from the Earth increases.  Precision tracking of both interplanetary and orbiting spacecraft has a wide range of scientific and practical applications, from measurement of gravitational fields for distant objects to precise orbit determination for geospatial positional and science applications.  We have recently developed a new astrometric calibration method for very long baseline interferometry known as multiview.  This method is able to measure relative astrometry in a single epoch with a precision of 10-20 microarcseconds.  This project will apply this new technique for spacecraft tracking and determine the impact of the frequency dependence of the core emission from active galactic nuclei on ultra-high precision astronomy both for spacecraft tracking and broader astrophysical and geodetic applications.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/physics/precision-astrometry-for-spacecraft-tracking,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/maths-physics/simon-ellingsen

Immediate burdens include the acute management of the injury, which is often painful or distressing for the individual and their families. This is further complicated because a dental emergency is a severe medical situation and requires immediate attention at a dental facility for consideration. In general, hospital emergency rooms do not have a dentist on staff.Response of paramedic services is essential in these situations, as time elapsed between injury and commencing emergency dental management affects trauma sequelae and its long-term consequences. There are recommendations that avulsions and dental alveolar fractures in permanent teeth should be managed within 3 hours.

Using photosensitising fluorescent proteins or fluorescent dyes and the mammalian membrane channel that can be activated by reactive oxygen species, we have established that it is possible to use light to control membrane excitability with better spectral separation and high efficiency. The project will aim to further validate and characterise the approach, develop ways to deliver the tools using recombinant virus and test whether the approach can be modified to become a multi-modal neuromodulatory approach to control neuronal excitability with ultrasound.

18 July 2022,Antibody mimetics for synapse modulation,Dr John Lin,"The project is part of the funded NHMRC grant (2021-2024) and will develop several antibody mimetic protein domains that can modulate the synaptic functions of neurons. Alteration of synaptic function is implicated in all neurological conditions and this either takes the form of reduced synaptic transmission or incorrect changes in synaptic strength. One of the key approaches to understand synaptic function is to experimentally manipulate proteins at the synapse but these often is done at transcription or translation level, or involves overexpression of exogenous altered proteins. The ability to be able to manipulate the native proteins expressed in the cells would provide a more accurate insight into understanding synaptic function and reflect the true functions of synaptic proteins. To do this, the project will develop single-domain antibody domain or fibronectin III domain based antibody mimetics that can be expressed intracellularly and bind to native synaptic proteins. In doing so, these proteins can either act as activator or inhibitors of the protein function directly, modified to alter the rate of degradation, or modified to be optogenetically or chemogenetically controlled. The goal of the project is first to establish a pipeline to develop the single-domain nanobody and fibronectin III domains based on mRNA- and phage-display approaches and develop the binders to the intracellular domain of BDNF receptor TrkB and calcium dependent phosphatase calcineurin. TrkB is implicated in long term potentiation and calcineurin is implicated in long term depression which are key mechanism of changing synaptic strength and believed to be the cellular basis of learning and memory formation. Once the 'hits' are identified, these protein domains will be validated in cell culture for selective binding in the cells and screen for functional disruption of these proteins. Ultimately, the some hits will be further developed as neuroscience tools to optogenetically alter synaptic plasticity.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/medicine/antibody-mimetics-for-synapse-modulation,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/health/john-lin

Preeclampsia is known to be a heritable disease and while there has been success in the identification of some genes, these identified variants do not explain all the expected genetic variation.  This project aims to identify novel rare genetic variation in families with a history of preeclampsia that may explain some of this “missing heritability”. You will use advanced bioinformatic workflows for whole-genome-sequencing to identify novel rare variants that segregate with preeclampsia in these families. Independent cohorts and publicly available databases will then be used to further screen these variants. This information will then be integrated with transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets to prioritise potential functional or regulatory variants associated with preeclampsia.

18 July 2022,Molecular drivers of prostate cancer metastasis,Prof Jo Dickinson,"The vast majority of deaths associated with solid tumours are due to metastatic disease. Aggressive prostate cancers (PrCa) are particularly problematic as these tumours have a high propensity to metastasise to bone. Five-year survival for men with bone metastatic PrCa lesions is ~6%, and current therapies available are both limited and largely ineffective. Lethality-based genome-wide (CRISPR/Cas9) screens are an innovative technique used to uncover the genes that underpin complex disease, the outcomes of which are seeding important advances particularly for cancer treatment. We have performed a successful lethality-based genome-wide screen in an aggressive prostate cancer cell line (isolated from a patient with bone metastases) and identified several mitochondrial-associated genes as the top ranked genes driving survival and metastatic behaviour. Mitochondria, as the cell’s powerhouse, are known to sustain tumour cell proliferation and survival, and this project seeks to uncover how these genes are critical to the metastatic cell state in PrCa, and further how this knowledge can be harnessed to develop much needed therapeutic interventions for metastatic disease. Our close clinical collaboration with both public and private prostate cancer treatment service providers has enabled us to develop a rare clinically annotated biospecimen resource comprising matched primary and metastatic tumour specimen.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/medical-research/molecular-drivers-of-prostate-cancer-metastasis,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/menzies/joanne-dickinson
18 July 2022,Literacy as a fundamental social determinant of (mental) health,Dr Amanda Neil,"Good brain health is an emerging concept that the WHO has defined as a state in which every individual can optimise their cognitive, emotional, psychological, and behavioural functioning; not merely the absence of disease. Brain health has been postulated as the key to health, the brain “the agent of all our actions and the mediator of all our experiences”. With a strong association between social disadvantage and poor mental health, poverty, childhood adversity, and violence are key individual risk factors for mental disorders.

When talking to a person who has had a stroke, he or she will offer explanations for why it happened on that Tuesday, at that time, with common responses including that they were doing something strenuous or were feeling very stressed. There is reasonable evidence from small studies of varying quality that acute alcohol abuse and infection are acute risk factors of stroke, but the scientific reality is that we do not understand the acute triggers of stroke very well.

18 July 2022,Healthy lifestyle score and CVD health,Dr Jing Tian,"Cardiometabolic disease (including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally and in Australia, with premature deaths largely preventable. Much of the prevention effort is focused on lifestyle modification and management of clinical risk factors in older adults but risk factors are common at young ages. Their prevalence estimates in young adults aged 18 to 44 from the 2017-18 Australian Health Survey confirm this: overweight and obesity (58.7%), physical inactivity (80.6%), less than recommended intake of fruit and vegetables (96%) and smoking (16.9%). Investigation of lifestyle risk factors can be complex because they often coexist (i.e. people with overweight or obesity are more likely to be physically inactive), thus a healthy lifestyle score has been used to summarise lifestyle risk factors as a whole. Few longitudinal studies have examined the longitudinal associations of healthy lifestyle scores from childhood to adulthood with cardiometabolic health outcomes in adulthood.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/medical-research/healthy-lifestyle-score-and-cvd-health,https://rmdb.research.utas.edu.au/public/rmdb/q/indiv_detail_warp_trans/39393

The CDAH Study is the only established study worldwide that has collected multiple physical fitness measurements, including cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness, on participants when they were children, followed them for over three decades and assessed their health and fitness as adults. In adulthood, a range of measures have been collected, including a blood and urine sample, heart and blood vessel measures, blood pressure, measures of adiposity, diet, and depression. As such, we are uniquely placed to address global research gaps by identifying how physical fitness measured at multiple time-points across someone’s life is associated with a range of health outcomes. To provide an overview of how our research group has contributed to current understanding, using data collected from the CDAH Study we have shown that children with higher levels of physical fitness are less likely to develop risk factors for diabetes and heart attack, such as prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, obesity, inflammation, and blood lipids, up to 30 years later in adulthood.

18 July 2022,Smart procurement in supply chain,Dr Hadi Rezaei Vandchali,"To achieve profitable and sustainable growth, supply chains need to adjust rapidly to market conditions (e.g. customer preferences, competitive forces) by predicting and responding to demand especially when it is unplanned. The recent COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need for being agile in the marketplace as the pandemic has dramatically accelerated the changes in consumers’ demand. Procurement agility will play an influential role in helping firms’ supply chain management to adapt to the new challenges of an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. By opening the door to new opportunities, procurement agility can help supply chains to react to sudden changes in demand, which can be considered as a characteristic of successful procurement organisations because firms with high performing procurement functions outperform their competitors. Agile procurement can cope with uncertainties in a volatile environment by monitoring the key metrics that measure suppliers’ health. For example, it can help firms to identify an alternative supplier that can be joined quickly to the firms’ supply network when the risk of supplying from the original supplier increases. This can be a call for a supply chain that can effectively adjust to a changing marketplace by seamlessly sourcing from multiple locations.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/maritime/smart-procurement-in-supply-chain,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/amc/hadi-rezaei-vandchali

The decarbonisation process for marine vessels will require changes to the onboard energy storage and usage as well as the necessary accompanying bunkering infrastructure. This requirement must consider several designs and operational aspects of a vessel. One of the critical aspects is the risk associated with operating with new fuels such as hydrogen. Operations in extreme environments will increase the likelihood of accidents resulting in higher risk exposure. A robust and reliable design is required for future vessels (i.e. ice-breakers) operating in harsh environmental conditions such as in the Antarctic and Arctic regions.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/maritime/safe-design-decarbonising-shipping,til.baalisampang@utas.edu.au

However, in recent history thousands of incidents and accidents involving ships have resulted in loss of life and property, not to mention environmental damage of different magnitudes. It is estimated that over 80% of all maritime mishaps are presently attributable to the human element and onboard human actions. However, from early in their careers, mariners have to attend formal learning environments to gain skills and knowledge that they need to practice safely onboard ships. Yet little is known about how this learning is applied practically on the job, i.e. what is transferred from one setting to another and how this transfer occurs. Through the investigation of the mariners in their formal learning environment (marine colleges) and in their workplace (on board ships), it is the utmost purpose of the present ethnographic study to understand the implications of this discussion in reducing shipping accidents. The database will be composed of videotapes, field notes, interviews and documents.

18 July 2022,Managing supply chains under disruptions,A/Prof Jiangang Fei,"In the recent decades, there have been growing numbers of large-scale disruptions caused by natural disasters, trade wars and pandemics. Due to the increasing interdependency of participants in supply chain (SC) networks, disruptions to any part of the SC will inevitably affect others in the same SC network causing adverse impacts on business continuity and performance. Accordingly, a decision made in one part of the SC to respond to disruptions may affect the entire network it belongs to. Current decision tools have two major shortcomings, one being the disintegration of decision-making leading to suboptimal solutions in terms of cost, efficiency and quality, and the other being the assumption that decisions can be made with certainty. The project aims to solve three key research questions: 1) what and how disruptions may affect SMEs in the Australian agri-food supply chains? 2) what are the challenges faced by SMEs when making decisions under supply chain disruptions? And 3) how can decisions be made to prepare for and respond to disruptions under uncertain environments?  To provide practical tools, the project aims to develop models for integrated decision-making under uncertainties.

The Tasmania population (0.515 million people) is less than 10% of the Singaporean population (5.61 million people). Yet, its land area (68,401 km2) is about 95 times that of Singapore (721.5 km2). While the availability of land and natural resources is a great advantage for Tasmania, low population density goes against it especially in terms of the supply and distribution costs, as well as social and economic connectivity.

18 July 2022,High-Pressure Diesel Spray,Dr. Javad Mehr,"Global concerns to reduce emissions are continuously forcing manufacturers to improve the efficiency of engines by optimising fuel injection systems and combustion process. Despite the wide use of injectors, the key physics of the fuel injection processes are not yet fully understood imposing a significant challenge for the development of more efficient injection system and combustion processes. The primary atomisation of the liquid fuel jet occurs in the region close to the nozzle exit, influences secondary atomisation, spray dynamics, air-fuel mixture quality, and ultimately the entire combustion process. Complex and concurrent physics associated with primary and secondary atomisation of liquid fuel induce more constraints for researchers to experimentally characterise the effect of phenomena such as swirl flow, flow separation, cavitation, and turbulence on spray dynamics.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/maritime/high-pressure-diesel-spray,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/amc/javad-mehr

This project aims to develop a quantitative framework for resilience analysis. The project encompasses two emerging areas of research, namely complex network analysis and resilience. Complex network analysis considers various measures of the network structure and connectivity such as closeness, betweeness and centrality measures, while resilience analysis considers the performance and dynamics i.e. recovery and adaptation of the system in response to a shock. To demonstrate the application of the proposed framework, it will be applied to study the resilience of the container shipping sector and trade. See Kanrak, M. &amp; Nguyen, H.-O. 2021.

18 July 2022,Effect of rudder deflection on vessel dynamic heel,Dr Javad Mehr,"Global demand for efficient sea transportation has led to the evolution of large vessels worldwide. To capitalise in this efficiency increase, these larger vessels must manoeuvre in ever more confined waterways. Operating in such confined waterways creates unsafe transit for channel shipping. Additionally, extreme drought condition has led to the low water level in rivers and consequently has interrupted transportation not only by larger vessels but also by the current vessels which could safely passed through the rivers in the past. To provide safe transits, all possible vertical motions and draught changes should be considered. One of the sources of the draught change is the dynamic heel due to rudder deflection. Operating in the rivers requires to remain in the provided safe course and vessels’ rudders are continuously in motion for course keeping purposes.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/maritime/effect-of-rudder-deflection-on-vessel-dynamic-heel,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/amc/javad-mehr

However, the legal status of these remains unclear since the laws relating to carriage documents were developed between the 18th and the 19th centuries. The International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading, Brussels, 25th August 1924 (The ""Hague Rules""), along with its protocols in 1968 and 1979 (The ""Hague-Visby Rules"") were developed during the period when no one would envisage even the development of desktop computers. While the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, 11 December 2008 (The ""Rotterdam Rules) contains some provisions on the electronic transport records but this international convention is unlikely to come into force. Earlier in 2021, the English Law Commission launched a consultation with an aim to formulate a statute on electronic trade documents. In Australia, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991 (Cth) contains an ""Amended Hague Rules"" as the Schedule in which a term ""sea carriage document"" has been defined to encompass electronic bills of lading. Same is true for the Sea-Carriage Documents Act of different States and Territories in Australia where there are provisions on ""electronic and computerised sea-carriage documents"". However, to what extent these statutory provisions are applicable to blockchain-based bills of lading remain doubtful. The purpose of this research is to offer critiques of the current legal regimes on carriage documents and identify why they are insufficient to accommodate the use of the blockchain-based bills of lading.

The comprehensive supply chain network design and optimisation is regarded as an important component in business management in terms of achieving the maximum customer value while maintaining the lowest cost. Australian supply chain networks play a key role in Australia's national economy and international trade. Mapping and optimising Australian supply chain networks increases the visibility of supply chain capability which reduces the potential duplication of resources and efforts invested by stakeholders and increases the utility of existing services. Theories such as Complex Network theory and Social Network theory, and methods such as Genetic Algorithm and Clique Percolation method, will be developed to solve the question and achieve the research objective.

Half of the Antarctic coastline is fringed by such shelves, and many are vulnerable to climate-driven retreat, with some already disintegrated such as Larsen B, Antarctic Peninsula. The latter’s final demise triggered a multi-fold acceleration of its former tributary glaciers that persists to the present day, clearly demonstrating the fundamental role that ice-shelf buttressing plays in regulating sea level rise. The processes driving and resisting ice-shelf retreat are still not well understood, however, including most importantly ice fracture and rift propagation that disrupt the normal assumptions of continuity inherent in ice sheet models and are highly dependent on the heterogeneous nature of ice shelves.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/the-stability-of-larsen-c-ice-shelf,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/sarah-thompson
18 July 2022,The nutrition of cannibalism,Associate Professor Quinn Fitzgibbon,"The prevalence of cannibalistic behaviours is recognized as one of the most significant limiting factors in the culture productivity of many commercially important crustaceans, including that for spiny lobsters. Cannibalism among crustaceans is a complex behaviour involving various biotic and abiotic factors including availability of refuge, social hierarchies, nutritional resources, and communication pathways. This project will focus on nutritional components associated with cannibalism with the aim of defining its contrition to growth in aquaculture and for developing mitigation strategies to limit its impact on culture productivity. Recent research at IMAS has shown that cannibalism during spiny lobster ""P. ornatus"" culture occurs as an act of aggression resulting in the killing and consumption of the victim when vulnerable during the process of ecdysis (moulting). The occurrence of cannibalism consistently occurs as a factor of moulting frequency resulting in increased occurrence in fastest-growing populations. Importantly, findings also suggest that cannibalism events are pre-determined and likely triggered by water-borne chemical cues released by the victim during the process of moult preparation and ecdysis. This project will first focus on the conundrum relating to the relationship between growth rate and cannibalism to disentangle the influence of con-specific nutrient intake on lobster growth performance. This research will involve in-depth nutritional and biochemical analysis with the aim of identifying gross- or micro-nutrient deficiencies which may drive the need for cannibalism. The project will then consider the impacts of feed supplementations with the aim of limiting cannibalism. This research may consider several avenues of investigation including; supplementation of potential limiting nutrients, dietary additives that may act as antagonists to chemical cues of cannibalism, and neurotransmitter precursors that may suppress aggressive behaviours.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/the-nutrition-of-cannibalism,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/Quinn-Fitzgibbon
18 July 2022,The impact of Antarctic sea ice on simulated Southern Ocean watermasses,Dr Will Hobbs,"Despite being only 6% of the global ocean’s surface area, the Southern Ocean dominates the ocean’s absorption of anthropogenic heat and carbon (Frolicher et al., 2015), with critical implications for the planet’s response to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Absorbing this heat and carbon, and locking it away in the deep ocean, relies on a complex interplay of wind and buoyancy forcing that drives exchanges of sea water between the surface and deep ocean, that is poorly understood. There is strong evidence that Antarctic sea ice is an important factor in this process, by forcing surface salinity changes in the polar Southern Ocean (Abernathey et al., 2016, Haumann et al., 2016).",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/the-impact-of-antarctic-sea-ice-on-simulated-southern-ocean-watermasses,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/will-hobbs

Research at IMAS has identified the aetiological agent of WLD as Aquimarina sp. TRL1 while health strategies to mitigate the threat posed by WLD are yet to be developed.Biosecurity is an essential aspect of this emerging aquaculture industry. To ensure the sustainability of lobster aquaculture the use of living organisms or natural substances that prevent or reduce damage caused by harmful organisms otherwise known as biological control or biocontrol is preferred to traditional antibiotic treatment and potentially hazardous chemicals. Bacteriophages are viruses that only infect bacteria and are one of the most promising biocontrol agents. Predatory bacteria such as Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) are Gram-negative, obligate predators of other Gram-negative bacteria and like phages are potential biocontrol agents.  Research into biocontrol to treat and or prevent WLD will form the basis of a PhD project and focus on the use of bacteriophages, and predatory bacteria (BALOs) as a health management strategy to prevent WLD.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/the-development-of-a-biological-control-health-management-strategy-to-prevent-white-leg-disease-wld-in-the-tropical-rock-lobster-trl-panulirus-ornatus,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/andrew-bridle

In particular the winds have strengthened, water masses have changed, and oxygen has declined.  New dynamical understanding and observations have shown that there are several hotspots of high poleward heat transport from eddies towards Antarctica (Foppert et al, 2017). These hot spots of eddy driven poleward heat flux are associated with standing meanders tied to large bathymetric features (Thompson and Naviera-Garabato, 2014).  The observed increase in kinetic energy (and poleward heat flux) is in contrast to the fact that the transport of the ACC has remained almost constant (Hogg et al, 2014).",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/standing-meanders-in-the-southern-ocean,Edward.Doddridge@utas.edu.au

18 July 2022,Reef fish population dynamics,Dr Nils Krueck,"Reef fishes support some of the most productive commercial fishing operations within the Tasmanian Scalefish Fishery (TSF). The three most important target species are Banded Morwong (Cheilodactylus spectabilis), Bluethroat Wrasse (Notolabrus tetricus) and Purple Wrasse (Notolabrus fucicola), with a combined annual commercial catch of approximately 120 tonnes over recent years. Populations of all three species are assumed to be sustainably fished. However, uncertainty remains about (1) the extent of potential localised population depletion, and (2) the exchange of individuals between heavily and lightly fished areas, which together has raised concerns over the long-term sustainability of local fishing operations. Better knowledge on small-scale reef fish population dynamics is of fundamental importance to the management of the commercial fisheries sector, given that current large-scale assessments of trends in catch, effort and catch rates are insensitive to potential changes in abundance at the level of individual reefs, which is the putative scale at which the fishery impacts populations. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical data to determine the appropriate structure and parameterisation of current stock assessment models to represent fish population biomass and exchange across shallow and deeper-water (&gt;30 m) reef habitats. Thus, better knowledge on the severity of localised population depletion and on the distribution of individuals across reefs and depth gradients have been flagged as research priorities of high importance to the TSF. This PhD project aims to address these research priorities by collating all existing data from various projects on Tasmanian reef fishes, mapping and characterising reef habitats across state waters, and initiating targeted field surveys on the distribution of reef fishes across identified gradients in environmental condition and fishing intensity. The project will thereby help improve the accuracy of and confidence in stock assessments. It will further help to inform options for future reef fish monitoring.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/reef-fish-population-dynamics,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/nils-krueck
18 July 2022,Reconstructing the input of bioavailable iron to Antarctic waters,Dr Taryn Noble,"The input and dissolution of continental material to high nutrient surface waters of the Southern Ocean plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon because it alleviates iron limitation and stimulates phytoplankton growth. Close to Antarctica, dissolved iron sources include melting sea ice, icebergs calved from glaciers, and upwelled deep waters. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing rapid changes in response to anthropogenic climate warming. Melting ice shelves and glacier retreat will increase the input of freshwater and dissolved continental material to the surface ocean, but the biological response to these changes (and therefore impact on the global carbon cycle) is unknown. However, we can study the biological and chemical response to past changes in ice sheet retreat recorded in ocean sediments to improve our understanding of how the system might change in the future. The focus of this PhD project is to quantify the dissolved iron flux along the continental margin of East Antarctica in modern and past climate states.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/reconstructing-the-input-of-bioavailable-iron-to-antarctic-waters,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/taryn-noble
18 July 2022,Predicting species size-distributions,Dr Asta Audzijonyte,"Natural populations consist of individuals that at any given time vary in their body size. The shape of body size distribution in a population can inform us about population status and species properties, but most analyses to date are based on theoretical predictions without extensive validations with empirical data. Many size-based ecological and fisheries models assume that the maximum body size of a species is fixed in space and time, yet empirical data suggests that species body sizes vary extensively across temperature gradients. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that that intra-specific body size distributions could be described with a consistent shape, but conditions under which this occurs remain unclear. This project aims to investigate statistical properties of intra-specific body size distributions in fishes and other aquatic ectotherms using a extensive global and regional empirical datasets across ecological and human impact gradients (underwater visual surveys, fisheries surveys, citizen science, angler reports, and others).",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/predicting-species-size-distributions,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/asta-audzijonyte

Apart from impacting on welfare and performance of fish, skeletal abnormalities impact on final product processing efficiency and lead to an increase in downgrades. New Zealand king salmon has been historically impacted by spinal curvature in their stock, and in the past two years there has been an emerging issue with intermuscular bones abnormalities (commonly referred to as ""pin bones""). These two issues indicate poor skeletal health in some fish stocks, and this is likely to become exacerbated by increased musculoskeletal challenge as seen in offshore environments. The goal of this project is to better understand pin bone development and abnormalities (and their link with spinal curvature) observed in king salmon as a reasonable proxy for assessing overall skeletal health.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/pin-bone-abnormalities-in-king-salmon,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/gianluca-amoroso

18 July 2022,Modelling downward carbon flux in the Southern Ocean: linking ocean midwater ecology and biogeochemistry,Prof Philip Boyd,"The oceans act as major sinks of atmospheric carbon. The biological pump is the ocean’s biologically driven carbon sequestration system. It has several key pathways for sequestering carbon (e.g., gravitational pump and particle injection via diverse groups of midwater biota), however, understanding these pathways and their interactions is not easy and therefore has seldom been attempted. Often the models designed to quantify downward particulate carbon flux in the oceans lack information on key pathways and their parameterization may only focus on a limited number of these conduits. Development of a holistic model which links these ecological and biogeochemical pathways will provide a much more comprehensive and accurate picture of downward particulate carbon flux across the oceans. Such a model will enable researchers to track the oceans’ ongoing ability to sequester carbon in response to climate change.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/modelling-downward-carbon-flux-in-the-southern-ocean-linking-ocean-midwater-ecology-and-biogeochemistry,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/philip-boyd

20 August 2022,Micro-nutrient requirements of juvenile tropical (Panulirus ornatus) with reference to requirements at moulting,Dr Basseer Codabaccus,"This PhD will aim to quantify mineralisation of the exoskeleton of juvenile tropical as a function of endogenous (stored) and exogeneous (food and environment) mineral sources. Mineral fluxes in crustaceans around moulting signifies specific physiological adaptations particularly aimed at maintaining the acid-base homeostasis. At the pre-moult stage, minerals are resorbed from the old cuticle and at post-moult stage, the new cuticle is mineralised.  Crustacea have some specific mechanisms to store resorbed minerals, particularly calcium from the old cuticle and which is made available to mineralise the new cuticle at post-moult. However, this endogenous source of mineral is not considered significant in marine crustacea due to it being readily available in the environment. Therefore, it is generally accepted that food and the environment are the main source for minerals in marine crustacea and the relative importance of these two sources are species dependent. At present, the ability for juvenile tropical to store and reutilise resorbed minerals is unknown. Similarly, the relative contributions of minerals from food and the environment is as well unknown. A quantitative assessment of the three potential mineral sources (stored, food and environment) which makes up the exoskeleton is key to feed formulation.

Examples include biosynthesis of novel signalling molecules, growth stimulators and phytohormones, and apparent loss of entire pathways normally considered to be core metabolic functions.  This project aims to combine flow cytometry with novel culture and culture independent approaches to capture, sequence and assemble complete genomes of phytoplankton microbiome bacteria from natural phytplankton blooms. Using comparative genomics approaches and curated microbiome databases, the project aims to identify genomic and functional adaptation of bacteria to phycosphere micro-environments that are critical to their interaction with phytoplankton host cells, and to primary production in the ocean.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/genomics-of-phytoplankton-microbiomes,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/christopher-bolch

These changes are driven by multiple physiological and ecological processes, such as food availability, growth, reproduction, mortality and species redistributions. A recent study by UTAS researchers showed that in Tasmanian rocky reefs, average body lengths for many fish species are changing by 0.5-1% per year (Figure). The associated impacts of such fish body size changes on coastal fish communities and ecosystem functioning are likely to be significant, and implications for fisheries management and conservation remain largely unexplored.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/fish-sizes-and-growth-in-a-warming-ocean,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/asta-audzijonyte

18 July 2022,Downscaling of Australian marine climate,Dr Jules Kajtar,"As with most of planet Earth, ocean temperatures around Australia have been increasing under global warming. Associated with this ocean warming, the intensity, duration, and frequency of marine heatwaves – periods of prolonged, warm ocean temperature extremes – have also increased (Oliver et al., 2018). Much effort has focussed on understanding changes in the average state of the offshore warming and their forcing mechanisms (e.g., Cai et al. 2005, Cai 2006, Sun et al. 2012, Oliver and Holbrook 2014). However, comprehensive investigations of the coastal effects of this warming, and how this affects ocean temperature extremes, have been limited due to the paucity of coastal oceanographic observations and the absence of high-resolution model data across the continental shelf. In particular, understanding the impact of global warming on coastal marine heatwaves is of great importance.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/downscaling-of-australian-marine-climate,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/jules-kajtar

Metabolically active microbiomes are essential for primary production in the ocean and contribute to development of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Imbalanced or depleted microbiomes can substantially alter the way plankton respond to environmental change, lead to disease and/or death of the host plankton cell, or modify production of marine biotoxins that poison humans of marine animals. Plankton cell microbiomes differ substantially from the background seawater microbial community, but how they are selectively recruited, and the principles governing community assembly remain unknown. This project aims to examine key parameters governing recruitment and development of phylogenetic and functional diversity of phytoplankton microbiomes using synthetic microbiome models, microbiome recruitment experiments, and microbial community profiling using high-throughput DNA sequencing.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/community-assembly-of-plankton-microbiomes,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/christopher-bolch
18 July 2022,Changes to ocean temperature extremes,Dr Jules Kajtar,"Marine heatwaves and cold spells, or discrete periods of prolonged ocean temperature extremes, can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems (e.g. Garrabou et al. 2009; Wernberg et al. 2013; Smale et al. 2019). Understanding observed and projected changes to ocean temperature extremes is critical for determining whether marine species and ecosystems may have the capacity to adapt to a changing climate. A common approach to defining marine heatwaves and cold spells is based on temperatures above or below the 90th and 10th temperature percentile thresholds, respectively, relative to an appropriate baseline climatology (Hobday et al. 2016). Using such a definition, it is clear that as ocean temperatures rise under global warming, marine heatwaves have and will continue to increase in their intensity, duration, and frequency (Oliver et al., 2018). Conversely, marine cold spells have been declining. But warming rates are not uniform across the global ocean, at least in part due to the influence of modes of climate variability, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (Holbrook et al. 2019). An added complication is that changes to the temperature variability, on a range of time scales, can also affect longer-term changes in the extremes.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/changes-to-ocean-temperature-extremes,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/jules-kajtar

20 August 2022,Amino acid requirements of juvenile tropical (Panulirus ornatus): towards the development of effective formulated feeds,Prof Chris Carter,"This project will focus on defining optimum protein quality by determining key essential amino acid requirements for juvenile topical and slipper lobsters. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the importance of between meal changes in tissue amino acid supply, balance and fluxes into growth or metabolism. The research will combine established and cutting-edge methods to understand amino acid metabolism at multiple levels and specifically related to how well amino acid requirements are being met or not met. Classic factorial modelling of amino acid requirements will establish the base experimental approach. Advanced respirometry, combining oxygen consumption with carbon dioxide and nitrogenous excretion, will determine changes in substrate utilisation within 24-h cycles and incorporate between meal changes in amino acid supply to tissues. Protein turnover will be measured because it underlies growth, is strongly influenced by dietary protein quality (amino acid balance) and has high energy costs. Stable isotope tracking to the level of specific amino acids will be developed and provide further detail on metabolic pathways and specific amino acid retention efficiencies (e.g. Barreto-Curiel et al 2019). Targeted transcriptomics or proteomics may then be used to understand how gene regulation relates to differences in protein turnover and amino acid fluxes. The research will ultimately help explain mechanisms that underpin dietary differences in whole-animal growth efficiency and provide a detailed basis for feed formulation.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/amino-acid-requirements-of-juvenile-tropical-panulirus-ornatus-towards-the-development-of-effective-formulated-feeds,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/chris-carter

The current pandemic has significantly impacted upon international enrolments, budgets are being cut and the impact of rapid online teaching responses have all taken their toll.  Academics are increasingly having to adapt and teach students from a broader range of sources that are too frequently ill prepared for University study. The entry requirements for some disciplines have also reduced over the past two decades leading to more ‘remedial’ teaching and support systems to facilitate student success. These entry requirements are perceived as being more informed by budget and enrolment targets (and considering attrition) than ensuring quality of outcomes, but there is minimal literature to suggest an alternative, tested model for selecting based on success potential.

How can I be sure that what I perceive is accurate?  How is it that the mind influences the body and vice versa? Is there something it is like to have a particular experience? Can I empathically grasp the experience of another? How is it that we can understand and share aesthetic experiences? Is it possible to identify an artwork or art performance as 'great art'?

18 July 2022,Maternal health information seeking,Dr Kiran Ahuja,"Maternal health information and healthcare-seeking behaviour is crucial to women’s health and is an important public health issue. Maternal and child health morbidity and mortality depend highly on the health information and healthcare-seeking behaviour of mothers. Several factors, including educational background, occupation, age, pregnancy-related complications, and socio-cultural influences are known to affect behaviour. Analyses of 13 years of Tasmanian hospital record data (through a data linkage project) have shown indigenous women have a higher rate of obesity and a high incidence of premature births and low birth weight in newborns. Tasmanian aboriginal women also have low education and socioeconomic status, low literacy, higher smoking, and alcohol intake compared to non-indigenous pregnant women. Tasmania has seen an increase in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations in the past 10-15 years. A large proportion of this population are humanitarian migrants with low literacy and low socio-economic status paralleling that of the indigenous communities of Tasmania. Additionally, often migrants arrive to developed countries with healthy weight; however inherent and environmental factors lead to weight gain in these populations often above the levels in the native population.  Very little is known about the health information and healthcare-seeking behaviours of these groups, especially pregnant women (or those planning pregnancy) in Tasmania.

This evidence has led to the Australian Government including referrals to and treatment by Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEPs) under Medicare for people with a range of chronic medical conditions. However, a limitation of the existing evidence for exercise as a treatment comes from laboratory studies that are highly controlled and often do not reflect clinical practice outcomes. Additionally, this research may not readily translate to beneficial outcomes beyond the conclusion of the prescribed intervention period/research study. To date there have been few assessments of the benefits of exercise services delivered as part of usual clinical practice on physical activity participation and health outcomes in people with chronic disease.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/health-science/how-do-clinical-exercise-services-affect-health-outcomes,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/health/Andrew-Williams
8 April 2022,Understanding compound climate extremes,Dr Kathryn Allen,"Climate and weather extremes may occur over weeks, seasons, or even years.  The IPCC has characterised compound extremes in particular as an area of ‘deep uncertainty’, with little understood about their probability of occurrence or cascading impacts. Instrumental evidence and climate projections indicate increased frequency and magnitude of both single event and compound extremes over recent decades and into the future, respectively. The impacts of some types of extremes – both single and compound - can be captured in palaeoclimate records. Because the impacts of more frequent or severe climate extremes are perceived as major threats to social and environmental well-being across the globe, there is an urgent need to better characterise these extremes. This will help to better inform infrastructure design and land management planning.","https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/geography,-planning-and-spatial-sciences/understanding-compound-climate-extremes",
18 July 2022,"Transport disadvantage, isolation and gentrification",Prof Jason Byrne,"Rapid urbanisation is driving social and spatial changes to cities globally. Its social effects include growing income divides, disparities in urban service accessibility (e.g., public transport), rising levels of income insecurity, housing unaffordability, segregation, and social isolation and loneliness. Planners have typically sought to address such issues through ‘spatial fixes’ (e.g., urban densification and infill). Purportedly, by efficiently using existing infrastructure (e.g., water, sewerage &amp; electricity) economic and environmental costs can be reduced. Higher density housing is thought to accommodate more people in closer proximity to schools, parks, employment centres, healthcare and other urban services. Evidence suggests such planning policies can have unintended consequences. These include rising property prices and rent, and gentrification. People able to afford higher prices benefit from better services and amenity, whereas those who cannot are displaced to the suburban periphery, with reduced access to urban services, and higher levels of car-dependence.","https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/geography,-planning-and-spatial-sciences/transport-disadvantage,-isolation-and-gentrification",https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/cose-ted/jason-byrne

18 July 2022,Renewable energy risk changing climate,Dr Kathryn Allen,"Renewable energy is a critical component of an emerging and thriving green economy, and Australia is well-placed to take advantage or renewable energy produced by a number of different sources. However, the risk posed by climate change itself to renewable energy sources, such as water or wind, is likely to have important impacts on the successful transition to reliance on renewable energy sources. Understanding long-term baseline conditions is a critical part of modelling risk for renewable energy sources.  This needs to be coupled with knowledge provided through regional climate models to obtain an expanded view of climate risk to the renewable energy sector going forward. A further question concerns how the financial risk to providers of renewable energy may be ameliorated in a way such that ongoing and responsible investment in renewable energy infrastructure is encouraged.This project will require high-level and transferable quantitative skills as well as excellent written and verbal English skills.

Advanced hydrodynamic design is critical in providing a responsive system for switching between generating and pumping modes while avoiding undesirable effects such as free surface vortices, surge waves, and unsteady machine loading. This project will use the advanced capabilities of computation fluid dynamics to simulate and optimise pumped-storage system hydraulics. Models will be developed to include dynamic effects in both closed and open channel flows. The project will also consider the operation of a shallow water reservoir, which enables wider options for site selection. This project will benefit the local renewable energy sector and assist in addressing a significant challenge for the Australian power sector.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/pumped-storage-hydropower-hydrodynamics,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/alan-henderson

18 July 2022,Numerical modelling of timber drying process,Prof Andrew Chan,"Timber, being a natural cellular material, has significant inhomogeneity and anisotropic properties. However, in order for the timber to become a viable building material, it must be dried so that all the free moisture and some of the moisture in the cells have to be removed. This is very difficult process to predict, and previous experimental work can only give a very approximate empirical guidelines. The purpose of this project is to use state-of-the-art finite element software like commercial program COSMOL or locally developed Lattice Boltzmann program with appropriately devised constitutive model to give a better understanding of the drying process of timber so as to devise a more cost-effective, energy and time saving strategy for the process.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/numerical-modelling-of-timber-drying-process,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/andrew-chan

Managing networks and distributed resources on networks so as to enable high hosting capacity of renewables and flexible loads and to enable power systems services to be supplied, while ensuring operation of networks within physical constraints is a considerable challenge yet to be resolved. This project will develop and test novel approaches and methodologies for coordinating and integrating distributed energy resources on constrained electricity networks, so that future networks can be operated to successfully address these challenges.

18 July 2022,Multiport Power Converters,Dr Waqas Hassan,"DC nanogrids have been rapidly developing to deliver clean energy to non-electrified and offshore settings. DC nanogrids consist of renewable energy sources such as solar PV and fuel cells and energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors to provide energy efficiently and reliably. Unidirectional and bidirectional power converters are typically employed to integrate PV and battery and provide stable power to loads. This architecture offers greater control flexibility and easy implementation; however, resulting in high cost and low power density. Three port power converters with at least one bidirectional port are an optimal solution to overcome these shortcomings. However, designing three-port power converters featuring voltage control and power management of each port with a simple control strategy while achieving high efficiency, high reliability, and low cost is challenging. Therefore, finding an optimal commercially available solution is difficult. This project focuses on designing and developing novel three-port power converters topologies and control strategies with high efficiency, high power density and low cost. The project involves deriving, modelling, simulating, prototype building and experimental testing the proposed topologies to validate the performance.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/multiport-power-converters,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/waqas-hassan

The fracture and calving process of icebergs accounts for almost 50% of mass lost from the Antarctic ice shelves. Thus, accurate representation of the fracture and calving process of the icebergs is the key to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of future sea level rise. However, it remains elusive and current predictions are based on simplified physics and do not reflect local stress – fracture interactions. The application of discrete element models has represented a substantial advance by allowing iceberg calving processes to be simulated explicitly but is prohibitively computational expensive when applied to the large spatial and timescales of Multiphysics thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling Antarctic iceberg calving.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/multiphysics-hfdem-for-calving-of-ice-shelves,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/hongyuan-liu

18 July 2022,Foundation Design of Tidal Turbines,Dr Ali Tolooiyan,"Tidal current turbine technologies have yet to converge on a single design concept, in contrast to wind turbine technologies. As a result, numerous moored and rigid turbine technologies exist for various water depths and tidal currents. Regardless of the technology, turbines must be supported on a foundation in a reliable and practical way. The construction, installation and maintenance of foundation systems form a significant part of the overall life-cycle cost of the tidal energy project. The success of the project depends on accurately predicting and designing the response of the foundation and the interaction with seabed geomaterials. Despite the ongoing growth of geotechnical engineering in foundation system design for residential, transportation, mining and wind energy infrastructures, design methods for tidal current turbine foundations are relatively undeveloped, using the most basic of geotechnical parameters, derived from qualitative geological investigations. Such methods are overly conservative, leading to unnecessarily expensive designs. This project addresses the need for improved design methods in clayey marine sediments, through state-of-the-art numerical approaches, employing advanced large deformation simulation methods coupled with realistic constitutive soil models.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/foundation-design-of-tidal-turbines,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/ali-tolooiyan
18 July 2022,Enhanced Pump as Turbine (PAT) Design,Associate Professor Alan Henderson,"The abundance of water resources and mountainous terrain of Tasmania make hydropower advantageous for both large- and small-scale power generation.  Micro scale pump as turbines (PATs) are a cost effective and versatile hydropower technology used for generating electricity on a smaller scale from water from a dam or river, or from an industrial process where they can replace a pressure reducing valve to recover energy that would be otherwise wasted. Micro scale PATs may also be connected to existing water storages to store and generate energy as required, effectively providing a micro-scale pumped storage hydropower system. This project investigates the performance enhancement of conventional PATs using two recent developments in technology. Replacement of the pump rotor with an optimised 3D printed rotor will improve hydraulic efficiency and provide frequency-based speed control. A wide range of materials may be 3D printed, including metal components. In addition, recent advances in power electronics now allow frequency-based speed control, which will allow for control of turbine speed and power output. These enhancements will significantly improve the performance of micro-scale PATs and bring benefit to the local renewable energy industry in Tasmania.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/enhanced-pump-as-turbine-pat-design,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/alan-henderson

Tonnes of feed per day can be delivered from feed barges to the individual pens, using sophisticated monitoring and remote feeding control systems. Salmon feed pellets are conveyed from feed barges to individual pens using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. Current arrangements for these pipes and their connections may be unsuitable for future more exposed sites, especially in the case of bad weather.  Damage to individual feed pipes and/or disorder in the feed pipe bundles may result from the greater relative movement of the different parts of the feed system, leading to substantial maintenance requirements and costs.

18 July 2022,Battery thermal energy management in electric vehicles,Prof Xiaolin Wang,"Transportation electrification is a novel green industrial revolution to tackle the transportation emission issues. The booming electric vehicle (EV) industry stimulates the development of onboard rechargeable power battery technologies towards a target of higher specific power &amp; energy, greater safety &amp; reliability, more environmental friendliness as well as increasing affordability. On the other hand, the revolutionary progress in battery technologies also drives the rapid development of the EV industry. In recent years, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells are favoured by many EV giants including Tesla, General Motors, Honda, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and BYD etc... Studies have shown that LIB cells can cycle more than 2000 times during 1C charging and discharging. With the rocketing specific energy and power values of modern battery technologies, the heat generation rates of the power battery packs increase rapidly. Although the theoretical operating temperature range of LIB is from -10 to +50°C, the optimal operating temperature range is 15 to 35°C as recommended in a report by Pesaran et al. from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In addition, the temperature difference between different battery cells within a battery pack should be lower than 5°C. Much research verified that the battery degradation rate and aging phenomenon would be accelerated when the battery temperature was over 50 °C. This is a big challenge for batteries to cope with the extreme ambient temperatures or the abusive heat generations during fast charging/ discharging without compromising cycle life and output performance. As a result, to tackle the challenges of extreme ambient temperatures and heat generations during normal or abuse operations, an appropriate battery thermal management system (BTMS) is crucial and necessary to maintain optimal operating temperature range, improve durability, and prolong the life cycle. This project aims to develop and investigate different battery management systems used in EVs.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/engineering/battery-thermal-energy-management-in-electric-vehicles,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/engineering/xiaolin-wang

18 July 2022,Motivational trajectories of primary school teachers for languages’ teaching,Dr Mairin Hennebry-Leung,"Anglophone countries, including Australia, are moving towards increasing provision of languages education in the primary sector. Language learning can positively impact on literacy, maths and science achievement, enhance children’s social skills and empathy, and their appreciation of cultural diversity. It relates positively to problem solving, creative flexibility, fluency and originality. It may also safeguard against cognitive decline in older age. Learning languages other than English can enrich participation in multilingual Australia, where over 300 languages are spoken. Yet, attaining this full potential requires effective teaching. While the Federal Government recognises the value of early languages learning and all states have undertaken or are undertaking expansion and enhancement of languages provision across the school trajectory, Tasmania is the only state still with no language education policy. Teachers in Tasmania thus face unique challenges to their motivation for languages teaching. Teacher motivation has significant impact on learner outcomes, teacher well-being and teacher retention, and the effectiveness of teacher practice.

18 July 2022,Learning analytics informed course design,Dr Frances Fan,"UTAS has long been catering for regional and remote students through online and blended courses. The current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has seen an even greater development of such course offerings across Australia. However, overall universities have observed higher student attrition rates and disengagement among these student cohorts. There is an urgent need for universities to rethink their course design and support strategies to enhance student engagement and retention. To address this significant issue, this project will use an innovative and comprehensive response, by integrating Garrison, Anderson and Archer’s (2000) Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework and emerging data analytics techniques. It will seek to identify strategies that are currently used in online and blended courses/units to engage and retain students, and develop a support framework for best pedagogical practices to build and foster a Community of Inquiry (CoI), to maximise student engagement and retention.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/education/learning-analytics-informed-course-design,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/education/Frances-Fan

18 July 2022,Critical citizenship in TESOL classrooms,Dr Mairin Hennebry-Leung,"With almost one third of the population born overseas, Australia is a key immigration destination in the Asia-Pacific region, yet difficulties in information access during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a social disconnect and isolation among immigrant communities. Language and citizenship are widely argued to exist in a symbiotic relationship. Through language, societies define and delimit membership, and individuals access and exercise rights and enact civic participation. TESOL sits in this nexus, yet few studies have examined the role of language learning programmes in navigating convergences and tensions between existing and emerging notions and practices of citizenship. This qualitative, longitudinal study will uncover the experiences of ESL students and their teachers engaged in migrant English language programmes to develop rich understanding of TESOL classrooms as citizenship development sites and of the role TESOL teachers play in this process.  The study will empirically extend theory on the language and citizenship relationship and expand knowledge regarding TESOL teachers’ multi-faceted roles in largely under-explored directions. It will also generate insights for community,for policy on migrant programmes and for TESOL teacher educators.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/education/critical-citizenship-in-tesol-classrooms,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/education/mairin-hennebry-leung
18 July 2022,Building vision in the language classroom,Dr Mairin Hennebry-Leung,"Vision building in the language classroom is well established as an effective means of generating and sustaining language learning motivation. As learners strengthen and concretise their identities as users of the language, they attach greater meaning to language learning, positively impacting on their motivation and engagement. Nevertheless, this concrete vision is particularly elusive in classrooms where exposure to the language-speaking community is rare if not non-existent and where the context of learning is far removed from the supposed context of language use. Extended reality teaching offers a unique means of bringing authenticity into task-based teaching and of creating rich opportunities for intercultural experiences. In doing so it offers unprecedented opportunities for learners to envisage, enact and reflect on their language identities. Yet, their potential for  supporting meaningful school-based experiences of language learning and to mitigate the motivational challenges often encountered in these settings is vastly under-researched.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/education/building-vision-in-the-language-classroom,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/education/mairin-hennebry-leung

18 July 2022,Speech movement and dementia risk,A/Prof Lyn Goldberg,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for 70% of dementia cases. There are three stages of AD: preclinical AD (pre-AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Pre-AD describes a phase where AD pathology progresses, for about 10-15 years, before cognitive signs of dementia appear. There is therefore an urgent, unmet need for low cost, accessible population-level tests to detect AD pathology across this continuum, with a particular focus on pre-AD. Cognitive tests lack sensitivity until the MCI stage. Specialist biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests, brain scans) can detect pre-AD changes, but they are expensive, invasive, and not suitable for population-level screening. Substantial research has documented gait changes in pre-AD, and recently that changes in the speed and variability of repetitive hand movements appear sensitive to pre-AD pathology. Complementing this, changes in the speed, rhythm, and accuracy of lip, tongue, and palatal movements, in isolation and combination (syllabic diadochokinesis [DDK]) may be a biomarker of cognitive decline, with age-related changes in sensory, motor and language systems impairing cognitive processing and task performance. DDK has been used for some time in diagnosing and monitoring functional decline in progressive neurological disorders, such as dementia; however, DDK has never been investigated in pre-AD, nor assessed precisely using computer analysis. Typically, DDK tasks are audio-recorded, then played back for manual and subjective analysis of rate, rhythm, and accuracy. In this project, the student will work with a multidisciplinary team (speech pathologist, neurologist, computer scientist, physiotherapist, general practitioner) to (1) develop an online version of the clinical DDK test, (2) combine DDK analysis with already-developed online analysis of repetitive hand movements, and (3) analyse the performance of adults who do and do not have cognitive difficulties to determine which combinations of hand-speech movement data most accurately detect preclinical AD to provide a more sensitive and inclusive means for detecting early AD pathology.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/dementia-research/speech-movement-and-dementia-risk,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/health/lyn-goldberg
18 July 2022,Saving neurons from neurodegeneration,Dr Rachel Atkinson,"Degeneration of neurons is the key cause of the functional changes in neurodegenerative disease such as those that cause dementia and motor neuron disease, resulting in the loss of the ability to think, speak, walk and swallow. We are investigating causes of neurodegeneration and treatment strategies to protect neurons. There is increasing evidence that different parts of the neuron, for example the cell body and the long processes known as axons, degenerate by different mechanisms. This means that a combination of more than one drug may be needed to protect neurons. This project will investigate whether there are axon-specific alterations in response to disease-related insults, as well as whether we can design combination therapies to protect both the cell bodies and the axons against degeneration. To investigate these aims, we will utilise the mouse visual system. The visual system is an ideal intermediary step between cell culture systems and transgenic animals. This is because neurons in the retina share important features with neurons affected in neurodegenerative diseases, but are much more accessible, and due to the organisation of the system allow axonal alterations to be examined.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/dementia-research/saving-neurons-from-neurodegeneration,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/health/rachel-atkinson

Specifically, by 15 years post-diagnosis, about 80% of people with PD (pwPD) have developed cognitive decline and 40% have dementia. PD cognitive decline substantially increases the risk of PD dementia but there are no precise low-cost methods to detect early cognitive decline; clinicians rely on insensitive pen-and-paper tests.

18 July 2022,Humanities-based Health Campaign,Dr Donald Reid,"The past decade has seen a growing awareness of the value of humanities-based approaches in the study of public health. This is manifest in the inclusion of social, cultural and environment factors in understanding health and wellbeing, and a growing emphasis on addressing the social determinants of health and wellbeing to improve outcomes for individuals and communities.  Elsewhere, media studies, notably in relation to analysis of narrative and audience studies, has been engaged in the development of health literacy programs. According to the Primary Health Network’s Needs Assessment Report (2019-2022), Tasmania continues to fall below the rest of Australia in a number of key public health indictors. This recognised need, combined with the state’s stable and predominantly regionally-based population, make the island an ideal location and subject for analysis of rural and public health. This project is designed to be practice-led. The artefact component will be media texts and/or a campaign. This may be situated in digital, social, or legacy media, or a combination of these.The media text/campaign will be co-produced in close consultation with a specific community and address an identifiable need to a specific demographic group. The design of the text/campaign will employ innovative techniques for working alongside communities, employing co-design and health-enabling methodologies.Accompanying the production of the text/s will be an explanatory and analytical exegesis.

However, the most often employed oxidants are extremely hazardous and typically require extreme conditions to facilitate the reactions. These disadvantages significantly restrict the use of such oxidants, particularly on a large scale, and make controlling the oxidative processes difficult, raising the cost of the desired products. To circumvent these disadvantages, one solution is to employ hypervalent iodine oxidants, which are environmentally benign, sustainable, recyclable, and very affordable. However, in most situations, hypervalent iodine reagents are inert towards oxidation of unactivated aromatic compounds, and unique approaches must be developed to activate them for this purpose. The aim of this project is to create such innovative approaches by utilizing our experimental and theoretical expertise to unlock the latent reactivity of hypervalent iodine compounds and to manufacture important dearomatized products at a significantly lower economic and energy cost. In this regard, we discovered a novel mechanism named ""ligand-promoted iodine(V)-mediated oxidation"" (LPIMO) using computational chemistry tools. This mechanism can serve as a foundation for understanding how to activate hypervalent iodine(V) reagents such as DMP and IBX towards the oxidation of nonactivated aromatic compounds. Currently, the approach is confined to the oxidation of electron-rich pyrroles with DMP; however, this study will allow us to use the synergy between experimental and theoretical skills to broaden the scope of the synthetic methods.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/chemistry/synthesis-with-hypervalent-iodines,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/chemistry/Alireza-Ariafard

These compounds do not degrade readily, and have a tendency to bioaccumulate.Most of the general public has been exposed to PFAS, and concerningly, high concentrations of these molecules are being found in soil and water sources. PFAS exposure has been associated with a number of cancers, and been linked to low birth weight and diminished organ function. The established methods to identify PFAS are costly and time consuming, requiring large laboratory instrumentation for detection and quantification, and taking days to weeks to obtain results. The work of the Kilah group has identified molecular structures that are able to instantly change colour in the presence of PFAS pollutants, allowing for the rapid and user friendly detection of PFAS at real world concentrations in soil and water. The detection of these pollutants is facilitated by supramolecular interactions between our coloured hosts and the perfluorinated guests.

18 July 2022,Mechanistic insights into homogeneous catalysis,A/Prof Alireza Ariafard,"The chemical industry is built on advanced catalytic reactions, and only these processes can ensure the long-term production of high-value molecules. This project attempts to facilitate the design of novel catalysts and catalytic reactions by enhancing collaboration between theoretical and synthetic chemists. To attain this aim, it is critical to have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind catalytic reactions. The complexity of the reaction mechanisms means that experimental findings alone are not able to fully elucidate them. However, computational chemistry by invoking the experimental findings can provide a more complete insight into the mechanism of metal-catalysed reactions. In this regard, for example, we recently reported that the reactivity of the gold complexes can be extended well beyond direct π-activation. We found that the gold complexes are indeed able to generate electrophiles that are more reactive toward π-activation than a gold complex itself (see: ACS Catal. 2021, 11, 9, 5795–5807; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 14599; Chem. Commun. 2016, 52, 9422). This project is aimed at investigating the mechanisms of similar processes in which metals are used to serve as a source for generating strong electrophiles which are capable of catalysing reactions such as functionalization of Olefines.

Kraft bleaching), it can then be processed separately either through pyrolysis to generate biofuel or other processes.  The project will investigate pressurised hot water extraction as a method for pre-treatment of wood-fibre from Eucalyptus Nitens and other plantation species towards lignin and cellulose as renewable sources for commodity chemicals.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/chemistry/evaluation-of-eucalyptus-nitens-biomass-for-generation-of-commodity-chemicals,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/chemistry/Jason-A-Smith

The recent construction and operation of Circa’s pyrolysis based FuracellTM process to manufacture levoglucosenone/CyreneTM on the site of Norske Skog’s Boyer Newsprint Mill in Tasmania has catalysed the need for development of advanced analytical techniques, hand in hand with skilled and highly trained analytical chemists, for a better understanding of the chemical nature and structure of its derivatives and a diverse array of by-products associated with its manufacture, and their potential applications. This presents some highly complex analytical challenges, particularly as the sample matrices and residues are typically highly complex mixtures. Control of the manufacturing process for these novel and complex derivatives and by-products demands analytical techniques that span a range of volatilities and molecular mass, thereby requiring the application of advanced analytical techniques using chromatography and mass spectrometry.

This project will focus on the development of a number of new stable radical systems. Introducing an unpaired electron into the backbone of a polymer results in a material suitable for use in electronics. Organic batteries, have a smaller environmental impact than a traditional batteries and are non-toxic. However, these systems are difficult to produce, because of the inherent instability of the unpaired electron. There are a few examples of stable radical molecules. The nitroxides and nitronyl nitroxide have been widely investigated as redox batteries. Another nitrogen rich molecule, the verdazyl has been less widely research. Although discovered in the 1960s these materials have been underutilised, likely a result of not being commercially available and traditionally being prepared from highly hazardous or restricted substances. Recently we have focused on the development of new safer methods to produce verdazyls and determined through electrochemical studies that they can act as a battery. Projects can involve the development of these molecules and other stable radicals such as N-hetrocyclic carbenes into electrodes for batteries.

However, these systems coupled with reductions in agrochemical use have created ideal environments for pestiferous insects including sucking bugs such as mirids and pentatomids. Further, due to consumer driven expectations, a return to chemically intensive berry production methodologies is no longer seen by industry as an acceptable method of sucking bug control. This project seeks to advance Australian integrated pest management (IPM) of sucking bugs in blackberries and raspberries by assessing the efficacy of potential IPM controls for these pests. In order to provide improved pest monitoring strategies, this project will also investigate the use of, and where relevant isolate and field test, the pheromone cues used by sucking bugs for pest control or crop monitoring activities in commercial Rubus production systems.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/management-of-sucking-bugs-in-Rubus,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/stephen-quarrell
18 July 2022,Impact of climatic conditions on fungal diseases of pyrethrum in Tasmania,Dr Jason Scott,"Pyrethrum is a major horticultural crop in northern Tasmania.  The Australian pyrethrum industry, the majority of which is situated in Tasmania, is the largest supplier of the natural insecticides, pyrethrins, into the world market.  Disease management in pyrethum is a major concern.  Diseases such as ray blight and tan spot represent a major risk to yield and the industry’s ability consistently meet market production requirements.  Managing that disease also represents a major financial and environmental cost.  Therefore, any effort to reduce these costs without major disease yield losses would be beneficial.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/impact-of-climatic-conditions-on-fungal-diseases-of-pyrethrum-in-tasmania,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/jason-scott
18 July 2022,"Creating high quality, sustainable meals with microwave assisted sterilisation",Dr Samantha Sawyer,"Shelf stable foods eliminate the cost, energy requirements and environmental impact of the cold chain. However, current commercially available options, such as conventional retort, require high thermal processing conditions which severely impact on the quality and sensory experience of the final food product. Microwave-assisted thermal sterilisation (MATS) is a rapid sterilisation approach to achieve shelf stable ready meals while maintaining the flavours, texture, appearance and nutritional value of freshly cooked foods. To be successful it must deliver foods of guaranteed quality that are significantly better than standard retort outputs.","https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/Creating-high-quality,-sustainable-meals-with-microwave-assisted-sterilisation",Samantha.Sawyer@utas.edu.au
18 July 2022,Cloning of a scald resistance gene in barley,Prof Meixue Zhou,"The scald disease-causing pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis is present in all Australian barley growing regions and ranks as number two regarding its maximum potential severity of yield loss. Losses occur regularly and are valued at $43 million per year. It’s also one of the two major pathogen diseases in Tasmania. Fungicides can be applied but add to the input costs and are prone to be overcome by the fungus if applied widely, apart from potential human health risks or unexpected negative effects on natural systems. The best strategy of managing the disease is the use of resistant varieties as a result of breeding and management practices such as crop rotation. The discovery of “perfect markers” linked to the major scald resistance gene is crucial for fast breeding program in improving barley scald resistance. The Grains Research and Development Corporation has just funded a few projects to work on scald resistance. We have also set up a proper system to accelerate fine mapping.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/cloning-of-a-scald-resistance-gene-in-barley,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/meixue-zhou
18 July 2022,Beating smoke taint in Tasmanian sparkling wine,Dr Samantha Sawyer,"Smoke-affected fruit is a significant cost to the agricultural industry and a significant risk that deters investors and industry expansion. Negative sensory outcomes, not apparent in fruit but manifesting after fermentation and wine making, means significant financial outlay has already been invested with little to no chance for financial return. For vineyards and wineries, this could also include years of sunk investment into ageing of fine wines.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/beating-smoke-taint-in-tasmanian-sparkling-wine,Samantha.Sawyer@utas.edu.au
18 July 2022,Barley yellow dwarf resistance in wheat,Professor Meixue Zhou,"BYD is a serious problem in cereal crops grown in Tasmania and high rainfall area of Australia. Most wheat varieties grown in Tasmania can suffer from BYD which leads to more them 20% yield loss. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) using over 300 wheat accessions have revealed some tentative QTL which are different from the gene introgressed from wheat grass. In this project, potential QTL for barley yellow dwarf (BYD) resistance in wheat will be identified/confirmed through doubled haploid populations. Further fine mapping will be conducted on the major QTL for BYD resistance.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/barley-yellow-dwarf-resistance-in-wheat,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/meixue-zhou
18 July 2022,Water deficit and phenology in pulses,A/Prof Jim Weller,"Phenology, or the timing of developmental changes during the growth cycle, is the single most important trait for crop adaptation. Large yield losses typically occur when critical periods for grain set and filling coincide with environmental stresses, chiefly drought and extreme temperatures in Australia. Photoperiod and temperature are the main drivers of phenology but recent evidence indicates that soil water content can also modulate progress of flowering in grain legume (pulse) crops. For example, both faba bean and chickpea show genotype-dependent effects of soil water content on flowering, and accounting for these can improve prediction and modelling.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/water-deficit-and-phenology-in-pulses,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/jim-weller
18 July 2022,Understanding beneficial plant-microbe symbioses,A/Prof Eloise Foo,"Plants host a wide array of microbes that range from the beneficial (symbiotic) through to the harmful (parasitic/pathogenic). Plants must both actively encourage intimate symbioses with nutrient-acquiring bacteria and fungi but also exclude and defend against those microbes that lead to plant disease.  Over 80% of plants associate with phosphorous-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while a limited set of plants associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The symbiotic pathways that enables plants to associate with these beneficial microbes is emerging in model plants but our understanding of the genes and signals in crops and the influence of domestication on these symbiosis requires further analysis. This PhD project will explore the role of plant signals, including plant hormones and peptides, and interaction with nutrient in crops and model plants to pinpoint key genes for potential crop improvement.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/understanding-beneficial-plant-microbe-symbioses,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/eloise-foo
18 July 2022,Transmissible cancers in Tasmanian devils,Dr Rodrigo Hamede,"Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are threatened by two independently evolved transmissible cancers, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD, first detected in 1996 in north-eastern Tasmania) and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2, first detected in 2014 in south-eastern Tasmania). During the last two decades, devil-DFTD evolutionary interactions led to genetic and phenotypic adaptations to the disease, and a significant decrease in its transmission rate. This suggests that DFTD is transitioning from an epidemic to an endemic disease, a key component for host-pathogen coexistence. However, the recent emergence of DFT2 has the potential to alter infection dynamics and ongoing devil-tumour adaptations. Whilst DFT2 has been only observed in the geographic peninsula where it originated, a rapid increase in its prevalence and spread has been observed over the last three years. To date, there is limited information about the epidemiology and population effects of DFT2, its interaction with DFTD and the extent to which this new cancer represents a significant threat for the already imperilled devil populations.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/biological-sciences/transmissible-cancers-in-tasmanian-devils,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/biological-sciences/rodrigo-hamede?elqTrackId=dc0ce596d2aa4fc0932e735108a62182&elqat=2&elqaid=219

Improved understandings of this heat and moisture movement given Australian solid wood and engineered wood products, temperate climates and construction practice is required. This project involves modelling of the thermal and hydroscopic performance of plantation hardwood-based CLT and similar timber-rich envelope systems in varied climate zones and validation of this modelling through empirical monitoring of selective test panels.

18 July 2022,Building a Tasmanian City,Dr Helen Norrie,"This project investigates the built heritage of Tasmanian cities, exploring the social, cultural and economic context in which they developed, through the lens of exploring the nineteenth century architects and builders of Launceston.  As the third oldest city in Australia, and one of its most intact colonial settlements, Launceston offers fertile ground for exploration. Significant research has been carried out on individual buildings and architects, as part of heritage and conservation studies that examine historical significance, but what has been lacking is a more in-depth study of the relationship between architects and their architecture and the broader physical, temporal, cultural, economic context in which they are located. The project will analyse the interconnections between key figures in the development of Launceston's urban environment and the local and global contexts in which they operated. This project is part of a wider field of research that examines the lineage and legacy of Tasmanian architects and architecture, investigating the connections between people and places and how knowledge sharing and resources have influenced the development of the built form of the state's cities. It extends current research into the history of Tasmanian architecture, beyond studies of individual buildings and architects to develop an understanding of the local, regional and global connections, and how these have been developed by networks of architects, builders, artisans, planners and communities, fostering greater understanding of the Launceston's growth and the creativity of its prolific makers. More broadly, the project will inform future architects, heritage consultants, city planners and communities on how the existing built heritage of streetscapes and buildings can be the basis of socially, culturally and environmentally sustainable future developments. The project's scope includes potential for creative and/or participatory design research methodologies, to explore and expose the diversity of spatial and compositional relationships between social, cultural and physical aspects of built heritage.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/architecture-and-design/building-a-tasmanian-city,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/cose-ted/helen-norrie

18 July 2022,Tasmanian Faba bean product technologies,Dr Adel Yousif,"Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) are in high demand all around the world with faba bean export providing good returns for Australian and potentially Tasmanian farmers and grain exporters. Agronomically, Tasmania is well suited to produce faba beans due to its mild, rainy winters and cool summers. Furthermore, Tasmania is well suited to develop sources of plant-based protein for both aquaculture use and the food industry. Faba bean protein has the potential to be used as a feed ingredient for monogastric animals and as a meat substitute to cater to the growing demand for the sustainable vegetarian and vegan protein market. However, faba bean must be processed into forms that are both nutritious and high in protein as well as removing antinutrients (Siah et al., 2021).",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/tasmanian-faba-bean-product-technologies,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/adel-yousif

18 July 2022,Stomatal functions in crop tolerance to combined abiotic stresses,Dr Chenchen Zhao,"Increased instability of climate leads to more frequent extreme abiotic stresses, such as heatwaves, waterlogging, drought and salinity (caused by soil water content decrease), threatening crop yield and grain quality. Besides, these environmental stresses happen simultaneously, such as heatwave with drought, drought with salinity, waterlogging with salinity under natural conditions. It is necessary to study whether there is a ‘common’ stress tolerance mechanism/signalling employed by crops regarding combined abiotic stress at a time, which not only saves crop energy budget but also increases efficiency in defending stresses. It is well documented that stomatal activity presents a high linkage with crop tolerance to salinity, drought, and heat. However, only limited studies have been reported to compare stomatal morphology changes or electrophysiological changes due to the scarcity of plant materials that are highly resistant to a few abiotic stresses at a time.  The proposed host lab for this project has privileges of using elite wheat and barley varieties as being a traditional institute for crop pre-breeding and breeding.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/stomatal-functions-in-crop-tolerance-to-combined-abiotic-stresses,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/chenchen-zhao

18 July 2022,Preservation mechanisms for space foods,Prof Roger Stanley,"Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilisation (MATS) is a new technology to enable the production of high-quality shelf stable foods for added value exports.  While commercial retail products typically need 1 year of shelf life, foods for Defence need a 2- year shelf life and projected space applications like the “Moon to Mars” missions need a 5-year shelf life in the presence of ionizing space radiation.  Flavour and related nutrient degradation, however, occurs over time due to oxygen radical and ionizing radiation catalysed damage, and chemical changes such as Maillard reactions due to carbohydrate content. This research project will look at  new ways to counter the reactions to maintain good flavour, colour and nutrient profiles in processed foods under the extreme storage conditions that may be encountered in exports to tropical countries or specialised foods for long shelf-life space and defence applications. The research will examine the shelf life of novel antioxidant combinations to determine and model the changes in food quality over extended/accelerated shelf-life assessment systems set up with Defence Science and Technology, Scottsdale  and space radiation simulation with ANSTO using an external ion beam.  The efficacy of hydrogen to quench high energy radicals and natural polyphenols to trap reactive intermediates of the Maillard reaction will be assessed for changes in colour by photometry, changes in volatile compositions by GC-MS, changes in taste by electronic tongue, changes in vitamin content by biochemical assay. Experimental design will apply response surface methodology to map the impacts of storage variables time, temperature and humidity on product shelf life deriving predictive models with Q10-values using the Arrhenius equation. Results will be applied to the development of technology to make extreme shelf-life foods to enable applications in space and extended food storage in hot environment.",https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/preservation-mechanisms-for-space-foods,https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/roger-stanley
18 July 2022,"Pink rot of potato, a reemerging problem",Dr Robert Tegg,"Pink rot is an important, but understudied global potato disease. In recent years pink rot has re-emerged as one of the most critical impediments to the Australian potato processing industry. Approximately 10% of the current seasons crop is estimated to have been lost to this soilborne fungal pathogen which causes infection late in the season both in-field and in storage. Recent epidemics have been promoted by conducive environmental conditions and the decreasing effectiveness of key fungicides. Epidemics can occur quickly and rapidly but knowledge surrounding what triggers sustained pathogen growth and infection is poorly understood. Certain soil environmental parameters are thought to impact pathogen success. There are also intriguing linkages between occurrence of pink rot and other important potato soil borne disease.","https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/agriculture/pink-rot-of-potato,-a-reemerging-problem",https://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/tia/robert-tegg
